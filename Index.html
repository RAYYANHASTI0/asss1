    <h1>Corona virus</h1>
    <p>The coronavirus, or COVID-19, is inciting panic for a n
        umber of reasons. It's a new virus, meaning no one has 
        immunity. <br> It is highly contagious, meaning it spreads fast. 
        Its novelty means that scientists aren't completely sure as
         to how it behaves since they have very little history
          to go on.
